/**
 * The database harness and the local fakes.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **A DATABASE TEST RUNS ONLY AGAINST A DATABASE WHOSE NAME SAYS IT IS A TEST DATABASE.**
 *
 * Not a convenience: `resetAdminApi` truncates every table this service owns, and requiring "test"
 * in the name is the difference between a red build and an emptied environment. This service holds
 * the **estate's audit of record** — the hash-chained mirror that SD-15 says is the only thing
 * that can answer "who did what, to whose data, and was it allowed" months later under dispute.
 * The wrong connection string here does not lose test data; it destroys the evidence every future
 * investigation in the estate would run on, and it does so in a way the chain itself cannot
 * detect, because a TRUNCATE leaves no gap.
 *
 * Only an `admin_api_test` database is ever created or written by this suite. The rule and its
 * wording are taken from `beacon/src/testsupport.ts` and `market/src/testsupport.ts`, because a
 * harness that differs per service is a harness somebody gets wrong once.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Not a test file itself: it is excluded from the build and contains no `test()` call.
