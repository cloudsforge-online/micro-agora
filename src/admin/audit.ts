/**
 * The tamper-evident audit log.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **WHAT "TAMPER-EVIDENT" MEANS HERE, PRECISELY, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT MEAN.**
 *
 * Each row commits to its predecessor: `hash = H(prev_hash ‖ every other column)`. That gives
 * three properties, and it is worth being exact about which is which, because a claim of
 * tamper-evidence that overstates itself is worse than none.
 *
 *   **An edit is detected.** Change any hashed field of row N and `H(row N)` no longer equals the
 *   stored hash, and no longer equals row N+1's `prev_hash`. Two independent failures.
 *
 *   **An interior deletion is detected.** Remove row N and row N+1's `prev_hash` names a hash
 *   that is not the hash of the row before it. The chain is broken at exactly the gap.
 *
 *   **A truncation is detected only against a checkpoint.** Remove the LAST N rows and what is
 *   left is a shorter chain that verifies perfectly — this is the attack somebody covering their
 *   tracks would actually run, because it needs no forgery. `audit_chain_checkpoints` is the
 *   answer: the verification job records "the chain reached seq S with head H and N events", so a
 *   truncation below a checkpoint names a row that is no longer there. An attacker who can also
 *   delete the checkpoint defeats it; the point is that they now have to alter two tables
 *   consistently, and the checkpoint is the row a backup and an external attestation carry.
 *
 * What none of this survives is an attacker who can rewrite the whole table and recompute every
 * hash. Nothing stored in the same database as the data it attests can. The chain raises the cost
 * from "one UPDATE" to "recompute every row after the one you changed, in one transaction,
 * without the nightly verifier running in between" — and SD-16 runs that verifier nightly and
 * calls a break a P0.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * **AN OPERATOR ACTS AS THEMSELVES.** `actor` is a principal — `user:<uuid>` or `service:<name>`
 * — and there is no route on this service that lets a caller supply one. It is derived from the
 * verified bearer token, always. The frozen estate's `/internal` routes took a `userId` as a
 * parameter, which is an act-as-anyone primitive: `deploy/gateway/dynamic/policy.yml` refuses
 * them from outside for exactly that reason. Where an action is taken on a user's behalf, the
 * user is the SUBJECT (`subject_kind = 'user'`) and the operator is the ACTOR. The two are
 * different columns because they are different facts, and conflating them is how an audit log
 * comes to say that a customer revoked their own entitlement.
 *
 * **APPENDS ARE SERIALISED, AND THEN THE DATABASE SERIALISES THEM AGAIN.** `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
 * makes concurrent appenders queue rather than race; `audit_events_chain_uniq` makes a fork
 * unrepresentable even if a future appender forgets the lock. Belt and braces on the one table
 * where a silent fork would be indistinguishable from a working system.
