/**
 * Outbox, relay and inbox.
 *
 * Rule 5 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: every state change others care about writes an outbox row **in
 * the same transaction as the change**. A publish after commit is skipped when the process dies in
 * between; a publish before commit announces something that never happened. Both are silent and
 * both are unrecoverable after the fact.
 *
 * No broker. Postgres already has transactions and `SKIP LOCKED`, and AD-10 records the four
 * measured conditions under which that stops being true.
 *
 * ## The inbox here is the audit mirror, and that changes what it is for
 *
 * 17 §2 requires every service to write "audit events for every privileged action … mirrored to
 * `admin-api`", and 13 §187 names this service's copy as the estate's "tamper-evident mirror".
 * So `POST /v1/events` is not a side channel on this service — it is the intake for the estate's
 * audit of record, and two properties follow that do not follow elsewhere:
 *
 *   1. **The signature is verified over the exact bytes, before `JSON.parse`.** An unsigned audit
 *      intake is a forgery endpoint: anyone who could reach the port could write a row naming any
 *      operator for any action, into the one record a dispute is settled against.
 *
 *   2. **Dedupe is doubled.** `(topic, event_id)` in `inbox` stops the handler running twice;
 *      `audit_events_source_event_uniq` stops a row landing twice even if a future handler forgets
 *      the inbox. At-least-once delivery guarantees redelivery will happen, and an audit log that
 *      shows one privileged action twice is wrong in the direction that gets an innocent operator
 *      suspended.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE SIGNING SCHEME IS THE ESTATE'S, NOT THIS SERVICE'S OWN.**
 *
 * This module used to hand-roll one: header `x-cloudsforge-signature`, value
 * `sha256=<hmac(body)>`. Every other service in the estate speaks `contracts-events`' scheme —
 * header `cf-signature`, value `t=<seconds>,v1=<hmac("<seconds>.<body>")>`. The two agree on
 * neither the header NAME nor the value FORMAT, and that had two consequences, both measured
 * against the running estate rather than read off a diff:
 *
 *   1. **Inbound, the audit mirror was unreachable.** A correctly signed delivery from a real
 *      producer arrived with `cf-signature`, this service looked for `x-cloudsforge-signature`,
 *      found nothing, and answered `401 bad_signature` — before the bearer check that was the
 *      other half of the same defect. So the estate's tamper-evident audit of record received
 *      nothing at all, which is what `docs/ecosystem/17` §7 claim 9 rests on.
 *
 *   2. **Outbound, this service's own events were unreadable.** The relay below signed with the
 *      hand-rolled scheme, so `micro-notify`, `micro-analytics` and `micro-activity` — all of
 *      which verify with `verifyDelivery` — would refuse every event this service publishes.
 *
 * Adopting the estate scheme is also strictly STRONGER, which is why this is the direction of the
 * fix rather than teaching the producers to speak the local dialect:
 *
 *   - **It has a timestamp, inside the signed message.** The old scheme had none, so a captured
 *     request stayed valid for ever. On an audit intake — the one record a dispute is settled
 *     against — an unbounded replay window means a captured "operator X reversed entry Y" can be
 *     re-posted at will. `DELIVERY_TOLERANCE_MS` closes it to five minutes.
 *   - **It takes a LIST of secrets**, so a rotation is a window rather than a flag day.
 *   - **It is one implementation, verified by its owner's tests**, rather than a fourth copy of a
 *     MAC comparison in a repository that does not own the wire format.
 *
 * Nothing about "verify before parsing" changes; that property was already right here and is what
 * the file header argues for. What changes is that the verification now matches what is sent.
