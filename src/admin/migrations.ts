/**
 * The versioned schema.
 *
 * Rule 7 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: versioned files, run by a one-shot job under an advisory lock,
 * expand/contract only. Nothing here is executed by `index.ts` — `src/migrator.ts` is the only
 * caller, and the service asserts the version rather than reaching it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **THE FOUR CONSTRAINTS THIS SERVICE EXISTS TO ADD. Each is a database constraint, not a rule
 * in a route, because the route is the thing an attacker is trying to get past.**
 *
 *   `audit_events_chain_uniq`        A hash may be the predecessor of AT MOST ONE row. This is
 *                                    what makes the audit log a chain rather than a tree: two
 *                                    concurrent appenders that both read the same head cannot
 *                                    both commit, so there is exactly one history and a fork is
 *                                    unrepresentable rather than merely detectable. Everything
 *                                    `audit.ts` does rests on this one line.
 *
 *   `approvals_no_self_approval`     `decided_by <> requested_by`. 13-operational-model.md:757
 *                                    says self-approval "is refused by the service, not by
 *                                    documentation"; this is the sentence under that sentence.
 *                                    The route refuses it first, with a specific message — but a
 *                                    route is code somebody edits, and this is not.
 *
 *   `approvals_execution_needs_approval`  A row may not record an execution unless it is in the
 *                                    `approved` state. An action that ran without a second pair
 *                                    of eyes is the single failure this table exists to prevent,
 *                                    and it cannot be written down.
 *
 *   `approvals_decider_is_not_the_subject`  Version 12, and the fifth. `decided_by` may not be
 *                                    the principal the row is ABOUT. The four above count
 *                                    signatures; this one is the only constraint here that asks
 *                                    who benefits. See version 12's own block, and the header of
 *                                    `src/approvals.ts`, for the hole it closes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **A NOTE ON VERSION 6's SD-11 CITATION, WHICH CANNOT BE CORRECTED WHERE IT STANDS — #317.**
 *
 * Version 6's SQL says "SD-11 requires an emergency freeze to be cleared by two". #317 read that,
 * together with the matching line in `src/flags.ts`, as citing a requirement nothing in the estate
 * implements — a rule named in the schema, no freeze action in `ACTIONS`, and `flags.ts` ruling
 * out the nearest mechanism. That reading is wrong, and the correction belongs here rather than
 * there for a mechanical reason: a released migration is hash-pinned by `@cloudsforge/db`, and
 * `migrations.test.ts` refuses a set in which an applied migration's text changed, so editing that
 * comment would make every existing database refuse to boot. Same rule as version 11's note about
 * version 5's column comment: read them together, newest last.
 *
 * The citation is accurate and the freeze is BUILT — in `policy/src/freezes.ts`, where
 * `REQUIRED_CLEARANCES` is 2, the same operator cannot clear twice because `freeze_clearances`
 * has `(freeze_id, operator)` as its primary key, and `DELETE /freezes/:id` answers 202 rather
 * than 200 until a second distinct operator arrives. Measured on mainnet 2026-08-10, both tables
 * exist in the estate's `policy` database and hold 0 rows: never exercised, which is what an
 * estate with no real users looks like, and not the same thing as missing. `src/flags.ts` carries
 * the longer argument for why the freeze must stay in policy and not migrate here.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   `audit_events_source_event_uniq` The mirror's dedupe key. 17 §2 requires every service's
 *                                    audit rows to be "mirrored to admin-api", delivery is
 *                                    at-least-once, and a redelivered mirror row that appended a
 *                                    second time would break the chain's meaning: the audit of
 *                                    record would show one action twice and an operator counting
 *                                    signatures would get the wrong number.
 *
 * **AND THE COLUMNS THAT ARE NOT HERE.** There is no `balance`, no `users` table, no `listings`,
 * no copy of another service's domain rows. This service is a BFF: it composes and it audits.
 * `audit_events.subject_id` is a REFERENCE to a row somebody else owns, and it is deliberately
 * `text` rather than a uuid FK — the subject may be a ledger entry id, a market case id, an
 * account handle or an on-chain hash, and none of those live here. If a column here ever starts
 * being read as the truth about another service's state, this service has become a second copy
 * of that service and both have stopped being able to migrate.

      --   1. \`environment\` is COPIED from the backup, never accepted from the caller. This is the
      --      2026-08-05 defect in schema form: the seeder took a target parameter and ignored it,
      --      so the parameter was never the safe thing to trust.
      --   2. The backup's environment must equal THIS estate's claimed identity. A testnet backup
      --      cannot be restored into mainnet, by anyone, through any route, for any reason. There
      --      is no override flag and adding one would defeat the entire control.
      --   3. A live restore must name an approval that is APPROVED and is for this exact backup.
      --      An approval for a different backup is not consent to restore this one.
      --   4. The backup must have SUCCEEDED. Restoring from a failed run is restoring from a

      -- THE MIRROR WAS NARROWER THAN THE CONTRACT IT MIRRORS. micro-org#265.
      --
      -- Version 5 wrote \`audit_events_actor_is_a_principal\` as
      --
      --     check (actor ~ '^(user|service):[A-Za-z0-9:._-]{1,128}$')
      --
      -- against the two kinds THIS service originates. It was then reused unchanged for the rows
      -- this service MIRRORS, which come from the whole estate, and the estate has four:
      -- \`ActorKind\` in contracts/packages/events/src/index.ts:70 is
      -- 'user' | 'service' | 'operator' | 'system', and \`parseActor\` beside it admits the BARE
      -- string 'system' with no subject at all.
      --
      -- Nothing converted between the two. \`auditRowFor\` takes the envelope's actor verbatim
      -- (contracts/packages/events/src/audit.ts:434) and POST /v1/events passes it straight into
      -- the insert (src/server.ts:777), so a legal envelope met a CHECK that refused it, the route
      -- answered 500 because there is no branch for "the database disagrees with the contract",
      -- and the producer's relay read that as transient and retried until its breaker opened.
      --
      -- MEASURED ON MAINNET, 2026-08-08, while verifying the 2.5.5 deploy: ledger had emitted 863
      -- \`ledger.reconciliation.completed\` — a leased job with no actor, so ledger/src/outbox.ts:201
      -- substitutes 'system' — and 10 \`ledger.entry.posted\` carrying 'operator:drift-correction'.
      -- Both topics are \`audited: true\`. \`audit_events\` held 205 rows, of which 4 came from
      -- ledger, none from an operator and none from the system. All 873 were refused; 20 were
      -- still retrying and the rest had been given up on and marked published.
      --
      -- The shape of it is the part worth keeping: this failed ONLY for the two actor kinds whose
      -- actions are hardest to reconstruct from anywhere else — a scheduled job and a human
      -- operator adjusting the ledger by hand, which is the act SD-10 requires two operators and a
      -- reason code for — and it presented as a producer's circuit breaker, which says nothing
      -- about audit to whoever reads it.
      --
      -- ledger is where it BIT, not where it ends. Two more producers emit an audited topic with
      -- the bare 'system' actor and have simply not fired yet on mainnet:
      -- tessera/src/kiln.ts:448 (\`tessera.object.anchored\`) and billing/src/entitlements.ts:441
      -- (\`billing.entitlement.revoked\`, from the entitlement-expiry leased job). Both outboxes are
      -- empty of those topics today. Fixing this only where it was observed would have left two
      -- services that break the estate's audit trail the first time a kiln anchors or an
      -- entitlement lapses.
      --
      -- And the estate already had the right predicate written down, once: tessera's own outbox
      -- CHECK (tessera/src/migrations.ts:1258) is
      --
      --     check (actor = 'system' or actor ~ '^(user|service|operator):.+$')
      --
      -- which is the contract's full vocabulary. This service was the outlier, not the pioneer.
      --
      -- ── WHAT THE NEW PREDICATE IS, AND WHY EACH PIECE OF IT ──
      --
      -- It mirrors \`parseActor\` and nothing else. A second definition of "principal" that is
      -- merely wider is how this recurs in the other direction; the only defensible width is the
      -- contract's exact one.
      --
      --   \`actor = 'system'\`   Bare, no subject. \`parseActor('system')\` returns
      --                        { kind: 'system', id: null } and every producer's envelope builder
      --                        defaults to this string for work no principal asked for. A
      --                        'system:something' form is NOT admitted, because the contract does
      --                        not produce one and a kind with an optional subject is a kind you
      --                        cannot group by.
      --   \`operator:\`          Added. An operator acting as themselves is the case the original
      --                        comment on this column was written about.
      --   \`@\` still absent     from the character class, so \`service:admin-api@replica\` is still
      --                        refused. That is not incidental: src/approvals.ts:409 and
      --                        src/jobs.ts:56 both cite THIS constraint for that refusal, on the
      --                        argument that an actor is an identity and two replicas are one
      --                        identity. Widening the kinds must not widen the subject, and this
      --                        does not.
      --   a bare uuid          still refused — src/audit.test.ts asserts it by constraint name.
      --
      -- The character class stays \`[A-Za-z0-9:._-]{1,128}\`, which IS narrower than \`parseActor\` —
      -- that accepts any non-empty subject, so a subject containing a space would be legal on the
      -- wire and refused here. That divergence is kept ON PURPOSE and is the one place this
      -- constraint may legitimately be stricter than the contract, because widening the class to
      -- \`.+\` is exactly what would readmit \`service:x@replica\`. Narrower in the SUBJECT is a
      -- deliberate bound on a free-text field; narrower in the KIND was the bug, because a kind is
      -- a closed set the contract enumerates and this service does not get a different one.
      --
      -- The column comment in version 5 ("A principal — 'user:<uuid>' or 'service:<name>' — never
      -- a bare id") is superseded by this block and is deliberately left standing: a released
      -- migration is hash-pinned and \`migrations.test.ts\` refuses a set in which one was edited
      -- after it applied, so correcting the prose there would make every existing database refuse
      -- to boot. Read the two together, newest last, which is the order they are in.
      --
      -- Existing rows are unaffected: every one of them already satisfies the narrower predicate,
      -- so the ALTER validates without a rewrite. Nothing is back-filled here. The 853 events that
      -- were refused and then marked published are still in ledger's outbox and are recoverable by
      -- replay, but whether the log of record should gain rows whose \`recorded_at\` is weeks after
      -- their \`occurred_at\` is a decision about what that table means, not a migration.

      -- The gap is narrower than "any escalation" and that is precisely why it survived a review:
      -- B cannot act alone, an audit row names both of them, and the request is visible in the

      -- that matters, which is the angle from which somebody stands to gain.

      --                             the same reason: the constraint is about a DECISION, and rows
      --                             that carry none must stay insertable.
      --   \`subject_kind <> 'user'\`  A subject that is a ledger entry, a moderation case, an
      --                             entitlement, an engagement account or a backup run is not a

      --                             an accident to be tidied away: \`subject_id\` is the identifier

      -- 'amount_shards' bigint on the transfer record. The executor in src/actions.ts posted both
      -- legs of every transfer with assetCode 'SHARD'. SHARD was retired on 2026-08-04

      -- programme it funds spends EMBER: docs/ecosystem/21 §2 has read "bounded, disclosed, and
      -- denominated in EMBER" since 2026-08-07, and §3 DELETED the "→ conversion to Shards"
      -- funding step so the treasury balance is one a chain can be asked about.
      --
      -- ── WHY EMBER AND NOT USD CENTS, WHICH IS WHAT mint AND billing CHOSE ──────────────────
      --
      -- Those two retired SHARD from PRICES. A price is quoted to a customer, is durable, and
      -- must not restate itself when an operator edits EMBER's administered rate — USD cents is
      -- right there and both migrations say so.
      --
      -- These columns are not prices. 'transfer_cap_shards' bounds a LEDGER MOVEMENT between two
      -- ledger accounts, and 'amount_shards' records one that happened. A ledger balance has to be
      -- denominated in something the ledger actually holds and reconciles, and the account these
      -- rows bound is already funded in EMBER by the only code that funds it: billing's
      -- feeRecyclePostings credits (platform:engagement-treasury, <settlementAsset>, treasury) and
      -- billing's settlementAsset is EMBER, typed IssuableAssetCode (billing/src/env.ts). Capping
      -- an EMBER account in cents would put the mismatch back one layer down, and a cap is a
      -- number the trigger below compares against the amount — the two must share a unit.
      --
      -- It also settles the payout question a USD cap cannot: the credit leg of a grant reaches a
      -- user, and no user in this estate can hold USD. 27 accounts already hold EMBER and the

      -- THE SEEDED DISK GUARDS WERE SIZED FOR A HOST THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. micro-org#511.
      --
      -- Version 10 seeded 'min_free_bytes' at 107374182400 (100 GiB) and 'ceiling_bytes' at
      -- 214748364800 (200 GiB). Both were chosen when the estate ran under compose on the
      -- Windows app host, whose backup destination shared a disk with the chain data — hence
      -- the refusal message's "this disk also holds the chain".
      --
      -- The estate now runs on a k3s VM whose root filesystem is 194 GB. A floor of 100 GiB
      -- demands that more than half the disk stay free AFTER every run, and a 200 GiB ceiling
      -- is larger than the disk it is meant to bound, so it bounds nothing. The floor is the
      -- one that bites: 'free - projection >= min_free' could not hold at any occupancy, and
      -- the runner refused every full backup for six days:
      --
      --     refusing to start: 95827013632 bytes free, this run projects 15254441761,
      --     and min_free_bytes requires 107374182400 to remain.
      --
      -- That is a guard that cannot pass rather than a disk that is too full, and it is worth
      -- being precise about the difference: no amount of pruning fixes it, which is exactly
      -- what the message advised.
      --
      -- ── WHY THE 'updated_by' GUARD, AND NOT A PLAIN UPDATE ────────────────────────────────
      --
      -- These are OPERATOR SETTINGS with a UI behind them (admin-web's backup-settings). A
      -- migration that overwrites them unconditionally would silently undo a deliberate choice
      -- on any estate where someone had already tuned them — including the live one, where
      -- these were corrected by hand on 2026-08-26 before this migration existed. Restricting
      -- the update to rows still carrying the seed's own 'updated_by' makes this a correction
      -- of a default and nothing else: it moves estates nobody has touched, and leaves every
      -- estate that has an opinion alone.
      --
      -- ── THE NUMBERS, AND WHY THEY ARE STILL ABSOLUTE ──────────────────────────────────────
      --
      -- 30 GiB free and a 60 GiB ceiling, against a 194 GB disk carrying ~85 GB of k3s images,
      -- volumes and Postgres. A full set measured 2.9 GB on 2026-08-26 (55 databases including
      -- the 22 adopted '*_testnet' ones), so 14 retained copies fit inside the ceiling with
      -- room, and the floor still refuses long before the disk is in danger.
      --
      -- An absolute byte count is admittedly the wrong SHAPE for a portable default — a
      -- fraction of the filesystem would survive a host change without a migration. It stays
      -- absolute here because the runner compares it against statfs output and changing that
      -- contract is a bigger change than this issue justifies; a host move now needs one
      -- settings edit, which is at least a thing an operator can see and do.
