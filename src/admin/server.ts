/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does
 * not pass CI.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **AN OPERATOR ACTS AS THEMSELVES. THERE IS NO ROUTE HERE THAT ACTS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.**
 *
 * No route on this service takes a `userId` and performs an action as that user. The frozen
 * estate's `/internal/*` routes did — they are an act-as-anyone primitive, and
 * `deploy/gateway/dynamic/policy.yml` refuses them from outside for precisely that reason. Nothing
 * here is an equivalent:
 *
 *   - Every mutating route derives its actor from the verified bearer token. `actor` is never a
 *     body field, never a query parameter, and never a header.
 *   - A user is only ever a SUBJECT (`subjectKind: 'user'`), never a costume. Where an approval
 *     names a user, what is being authorised is an action on a thing that user owns — an
 *     entitlement, a ledger entry — performed by the operator, recorded as the operator.
 *   - A SERVICE token cannot request, approve or execute anything. It can read (`admin:read`), and
 *     that is now the entire service vocabulary. Approval is consent given by a person, and a
 *     service is not a person; a service token that could approve would make the four-eyes control
 *     satisfiable by two credentials on one machine.
 *
 * **`POST /v1/events` IS SIGNATURE-CHECKED BEFORE IT IS PARSED, AND READS NO BEARER.** It is the
 * intake for the whole estate's audit mirror (17 §2). An unsigned intake there is a forgery
 * endpoint: anyone who can reach the port could write a row into the record a dispute is settled
 * against, naming any operator for any action. The body is verified with `contracts-events`'
 * `verifyDelivery` against `OUTBOX_SIGNING_SECRET`, over the exact bytes received, BEFORE
 * `JSON.parse` is called on it.
 *
 * It used to demand `admin:audit:write` as well. No outbox relay in this estate can present a
 * bearer, and this service was additionally verifying a signature format nobody sends, so the
 * mirror received nothing at all — the route below carries the full argument, what was given up,
 * and what would restore it.
 *
 * **EVERY MUTATING ROUTE IS IDEMPOTENT.** `routeidempotency.test.ts` enumerates them from this
 * file's source and fails on one that neither wraps `withIdempotentRoute` nor states why it need
 * not. `micro-market` gained that guard after two routes were found with none, and both of them
 * created a durable artefact on every retry.
 *
 * **THE SCOPE MATCHER IS EXACT, DELIBERATELY** — the §3.3h decision, argued in `scopes.ts`.
 * `admin:*` is refused here and accepted by a sibling that calls `hasScope`; that difference is a
 * recorded choice, pinned in both directions by `scopes.test.ts`, and neither auth package is
 * changed by this repository.

     *
     * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     * **MAC-ONLY. NO BEARER TOKEN IS READ HERE, AND THAT IS THE REPAIR.**
     *
     * This route had TWO independent walls, either of which alone made it undeliverable, and both
     * were measured against the running estate before being touched:
     *
     *   1. **The wrong signature scheme.** It verified `x-cloudsforge-signature: sha256=<hmac>`,
     *      a format this repository invented. Every producer sends `cf-signature:
     *      t=<s>,v1=<hmac>`. A correctly signed delivery answered `401 bad_signature`. See
     *      `outbox.ts`'s signing header for why adopting the estate scheme is strictly stronger
     *      (it has a replay window; the local one had none).
     *   2. **A bearer and an `admin:audit:write` scope no producer can present.** An outbox relay
     *      is a background job woken by a Postgres poll — no session, no user, no way to mint a
     *      token. All twenty-one relays in the estate were read, not assumed: every one sends the
     *      signature and the event id and NOTHING else. Presenting the local scheme's signature
     *      with no `Authorization` answered `401 unauthenticated`.
     *
     * So the mirror for all 26 audited topics received nothing, ever — which
     * `deploy/README.md` had already recorded as making 17 §7 claim 9 unpassable. **An empty
     * operator timeline during an incident looks like an answer**, and that is the worst failure
     * mode this tool has: an operator asks "where did this user's money go", sees nothing, and
     * concludes nothing happened.
     *
     * **WHAT WAS LOST, STATED PLAINLY RATHER THAN GLOSSED.** `source` used to be the
     * scope-checked principal's service name, and an envelope whose `producer` disagreed with it
     * was refused — "a service may mirror its own rows, not somebody else's". That check is gone
     * with the bearer, and `source` is now `event.producer`. The residual risk is real and worth
     * naming: any holder of the estate outbox secret can now mirror a row attributed to any
     * producer. What still stands behind it is that `validateEnvelope` requires the producer to
     * own the topic namespace, so a forged row must at least be internally consistent, and that
     * the secret is held only by services — never by a browser and never by an operator.
     *
     * **This is not a net weakening**, because the alternative was not "keep the check": the
     * check was attached to a route that refused 100% of legitimate traffic, so it protected
     * nothing that existed. A no-rows audit log is not a safer audit log. The honest fix that
     * restores the distinction is a PER-PRODUCER signing secret rather than one estate-wide
     * secret, which is a `micro-deploy` and `contracts-events` change and is reported there.

        // state and the one an operator can act on. Rolling the approval back would erase the
        // record that two operators agreed, and retrying would then need a third signature for
        // something already authorised twice. `recordExecution` is at-most-once, and every
        // executor is idempotent at its upstream, so a retry is safe.
        //
        // ── AND THERE IS NO SEPARATE EXECUTE STEP. THAT IS A DECISION — micro-org#317. ──
        //
        // The second signature and the trigger are ONE HTTP call. The approver is therefore always
        // the executor, and there is no window in which an approved-but-unrun action sits waiting
        // to be inspected, delayed or withdrawn. #317 asked whether that was chosen or inherited.
        // It is chosen, and the argument is this:
        //
        //   * A separate execute step adds a THIRD moment a human must show up, and it is the
        //     moment with the least information attached — the decision has already been made and
        //     recorded, so whoever presses it is either re-litigating a signed approval or is a
        //     rubber stamp. This estate has one control that depends entirely on operators not
        //     signing reflexively, and adding a step that teaches them to is how it is lost.
        //     `ActionSpec.approval = 'read'` exists for the same reason, one layer up.
        //   * The window would not be a review window unless something WATCHED it, and nothing
        //     does: there is no notification on any action here (#165's gap), so an approved row
        //     would sit unread until the person who approved it came back for it.
        //   * The delay is not free. Six of the seven executable actions reverse a bad ledger
        //     entry, resolve a moderation case, revoke an entitlement or fund an engagement
        //     account — all of them things somebody is waiting on during an incident, and all of

 *
 * How it got here is worth a line, because it is the same defect as #317's headline in miniature:
 * a doc comment was left attached to the helper that used to follow it when the code between them
 * moved. Nothing failed. A comment cannot be typechecked, and there is no test that can be written
 * for "this paragraph is about the function under it" — which is why the rest of this repository
 * spends its comments on measurements and reasons rather than on restating what the code does.

 * **THE MINIMAL REMOUNT, AND THE TWO FINDINGS THAT MADE IT MINIMAL.**
 *
 * The first design for this module remounted all thirty-one routes under `/v1/admin/*` behind one
 * gateway rewrite — the same shape hub uses. Two facts killed it:
 *
 *   1. **wallet already owns `GET /v1/admin/exchange-desk` and
 *      `POST /v1/admin/exchange-desk/funding`.** A blanket `/v1/admin` namespace for this module
 *      would have collided with the one module in this process whose paths cannot move, and
 *      `/v1/admin/exchange-desk` is a money route.
 *   2. **billing calls this module's BARE `/v1/engagement/policies` service-to-service**
 *      (`billing/adminapi.ts`, scope `admin:read`) — over HTTP, by service name, bypassing the
 *      gateway entirely. A rewrite at the gateway cannot reach that call, so a blanket remount
 *      would have broken it silently: billing would get the host's 404 and fall back to its
 *      defaults, which look exactly like a policy that says what the defaults say.
 *
 * So only the collision moves. `GET /v1/worlds` is nda's — the PUBLIC owner, routed on
 * `api.<apex>` by `cf-api-nda`, and the whole of *Ninety Days After* below that prefix. This
 * module's `/v1/worlds` is the operator's world-control proxy on the ADMIN host behind Access,
 * and it is the one that gives way.
 *
 * **All five move together, not just the colliding one.** Only `GET /v1/worlds` actually shadows
 * (nda declares no `POST /v1/worlds`, no `/v1/worlds/:id/start`, `/tick` or `/bots`). Splitting
 * them — one path under `/v1/operator` and four bare — would put the operator's world controls at
 * two addresses and leave the next route added on whichever side its author happened to copy. The
 * four non-colliding ones move because they belong with the one that had to.
 *
 * **THIS IS ONLY HALF A FIX WITHOUT THE GATEWAY.** admin-web asks `/v1/worlds` relative to the
 * admin host, so `cf-api-admin` must rewrite `^/v1/worlds(.*)` to `/v1/operator/worlds$1` in the
 * same release. Wave M5b remounted tessera's `/v1/listings` and did NOT do this, and the measured
 * consequence was market answering tessera's listings — 200 with an empty array, unauthenticated,
 * on every signed-in user's page. A remount and its rewrite ship together or neither ships.

/**
 * This module's routes, ready to mount beside agora's.
 *
 * Three things happen here and nowhere else, which is what makes them impossible to forget per
 * handler:
 *
 *   1. **Every spec is stamped with THIS module's selector.** The kernel resolves one handle per
 *      request from one selector, and the host's is agora's. Unstamped, every read below would run
 *      against agora's database — where `inbox` and `jobs` exist with the same columns, so the
 *      write SUCCEEDS and reports nothing. In THIS module the table at risk is `audit`, a
 *      hash-chained log whose whole value is that it cannot be written anywhere else.
 *   2. **The handler closes over THIS module's deps, rebuilt for THIS request.** `RouteSpec.handle`
 *      takes only `ctx`, so there is no parameter through which the host's upstreams could arrive.
 *      `forRequest(deps, ctx.network)` narrows every peer client to the estate the gateway stamped.
 *   3. **The events path is suffixed and the four world paths are remounted.** See above.
