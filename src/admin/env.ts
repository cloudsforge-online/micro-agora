/**
 * Configuration, validated at import.
 *
 * Rule 9 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2 — "a repo declares the variables it needs; the deploy provides
 * exactly those" — is a property of this file. Every variable this service reads is named here and
 * nowhere else, so the deploy manifest can be derived from it and `env_file: .env` fan-out (which
 * hands every container the whole estate's secrets) has nothing to justify it.
 *
 * Two behaviours are inherited from market, which took them from worlds, which took them from
 * custody:
 *
 *   1. **A missing variable names itself.** `undefined` propagating into a connection string
 *      surfaces four layers later as an unreadable driver error.
 *   2. **A placeholder is refused outright.** A default secret in source is not convenient, it is
 *      catastrophic, and a placeholder that boots is a placeholder that reaches production. What
 *      makes that refusal real rather than decorative is that `@cloudsforge/secrets` checks the
 *      SHAPE of a value rather than membership of a list of exact strings — see the block where
 *      this file's own `PLACEHOLDERS` set used to be.
 *
 * ## Why the upstream URLs are all required and none of them is optional
 *
 * This service composes an operator's view of the estate. A missing upstream URL would render as a
 * permanently unavailable tile, and an operator reading a console during an incident cannot tell a
 * tile that is down from a tile that was never configured. So every upstream this service knows
 * how to call is named at boot, and its absence is a boot failure rather than a silent hole in the
 * console. The tiles then degrade for the one reason a tile is allowed to degrade: the upstream is
 * actually unwell.
 *
 * ## Naming, and the guard that shaped it
 *
 * `secret-hygiene` refuses an `.env.example` line whose NAME matches `*SECRET*|*TOKEN*|*KEY*` and
 * whose value does not look like a placeholder. `micro-devplatform` hit this with a duration
 * called `…_SECRET_OVERLAP_MINUTES` and renamed the variable rather than weakening the guard. Two
 * durations here would have had the same problem — the approval TTL and the audit verification
 * window — and both are named `…_MINUTES` / `…_DAYS` with no credential vocabulary in them. The
 * only variables in this file carrying `TOKEN` or `SECRET` in their names are credentials.

/**
 * A SERVICE CREDENTIAL that may be absent, but must be REAL if present.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS REFUSES THE VALUE THE LIVE ESTATE IS RUNNING TODAY, AND THAT IS THE POINT — #222.**
 *
 * Measured live on 2026-08-05: `ADMIN_API_SERVICE_TOKEN` held a 701-byte JWT that had **expired 26
 * hours earlier**, on a container reporting healthy. It was genuinely read — `index.ts` closed over
 * `env.serviceToken` and `upstreams.ts` put it verbatim in the `authorization` header of every
 * ledger call a `{ kind: 'service' }` credential names, because `ledger/src/server.ts`'s
 * `authorise` refuses a user principal outright. So every reversal and every trial-balance read
 * this service made since that expiry answered 401, while `/livez` stayed green — the healthcheck
 * never exercises the credential, which is why nothing noticed for a day.
 *
 * A JWT read once at boot is dead ten minutes later, and dead on the next restart at the latest;
 * that is the ten-minute cliff (#197) wearing a variable name that looks fine.
 * `assertServiceCredential` refuses a JWT BY NAME, so a deployment still passing one will not
 * boot until it is replaced by a real `cfsc_` credential from `deploy/scripts/estate-bootstrap.sh`.
 * No JWT exemption and no weaker assertion.
 *
 * ── WHY `null` RATHER THAN `''`, AND WHY THE EMPTY CHECK COMES FIRST ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Compose interpolates `${ADMIN_API_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL:-}`, so an UNSET credential arrives as the
 * EMPTY STRING rather than as `undefined`. That is the supported "not configured yet" mode, not a
 * malformed value, and `migrator.ts` shares this environment while dialling nobody — turning it
 * into `exit(1)` would fail `admin-api-migrate`, which the service's own compose block waits on
 * through `service_completed_successfully`. `null` says the absence once; `''` is falsy exactly
 * where a caller tests for it and truthy in `Object.keys`, which is how a mode gets chosen by
 * accident.
 *
 * What is NOT supported is a value that is present and rubbish. A 20-character placeholder is a
 * deployment that BELIEVES it has a credential, and it fails on its first ledger call with a 401
 * that reads exactly like the ledger being unwell.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT `assertGeneratedSecret` ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because it would refuse every credential this estate has ever minted, on both networks. A
 * credential is `cfsc_` + base64url, which is neither wholly base64 nor wholly hex — the underscore
 * in its own prefix disqualifies it — and **the testnet body CONTAINS A HYPHEN while the mainnet
 * body does not**, so the "no hyphens" instinct that is correct for the signing key above reads as
 * obviously right, passes mainnet, and kills testnet at boot.
