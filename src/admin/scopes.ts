/**
 * This service's scope vocabulary, and the matcher it uses.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE §3.3h DECISION: EXACT MATCH ONLY, ON THIS SERVICE, DELIBERATELY.**
 *
 * 18-build-status.md §3.3h records that the estate ships two scope matchers that disagree:
 *
 *   | `contracts/packages/auth` | `src/index.ts` | `granted.includes(required)` — exact only |
 *   | `runtime/packages/auth`   | `src/index.ts` | one wildcard level: `foo:*` grants `foo:bar` |
 *
 * Both are shipped, both are CI-green, and neither is wrong on its own terms. **Neither is changed
 * by this repository**, per §3.3h's conclusion that changing an authorisation matcher is the
 * highest-blast-radius edit available in this estate and wants the owner rather than an agent.
 *
 * This service imports `@cloudsforge/auth` from **runtime** — as every service here does — and
 * then deliberately does NOT call its `hasScope`. `requireAdminScope` below uses `includes`,
 * which is the contracts-package reading. Three reasons, in increasing order of weight:
 *
 *   1. **The blast radius is asymmetric.** Over-granting on the operator surface hands somebody
 *      the estate. Under-granting hands somebody a 403 they can get fixed in a morning. When two
 *      readings are both defensible, the one whose failure is recoverable wins.
 *
 *   2. **`admin:*` is exactly the credential this estate exists to remove.** The wildcard form is
 *      documented and deliberate in runtime — a *bare* `*` still grants nothing — but `admin:*`
 *      is one string that grants approving a ledger reversal, flipping a feature flag, publishing
 *      a broadcast and reading the estate's audit of record. That is `PAY_SERVICE_TOKEN` with a
 *      new spelling (SD-05, SD-12).
 *
 *   3. **`micro-devplatform` already navigated it this way**, using `includes` rather than
 *      `hasScope` on `/internal/keys/verify` with a test proving `devplatform:*` is refused. A
 *      credential service and an operator surface should not be the two places the estate
 *      discovers its wildcard semantics differ, and consistency between them is worth more than
 *      either answer.
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: a service token issued as `admin-api:*` will be refused
 * here and accepted by a sibling that calls `hasScope`. `scopes.test.ts` pins that in both
 * directions so the difference is a recorded decision rather than a surprise.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * **AND THE SCOPE NOBODY HAS.** There is no `admin:execute` that a service token can hold. Every
 * action that changes something in another service travels through the approval queue, and an
 * approval names two *human* operators. A service token on this surface can read, and nothing
 * else: it cannot request, approve or execute. See `server.ts`.

export const ADMIN_READ_SCOPE = 'admin:read'

/**
 * **`admin:audit:write` IS GONE, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE POINT.**
 *
 * It gated `POST /v1/events`, the audit mirror. No service could ever hold it in a way that
 * reached that route: an outbox relay is a background job woken by a Postgres poll and sends the
 * delivery signature and the event id and nothing else — all twenty-one relays in the estate were
 * read, not assumed. So the scope described a capability that was exercised zero times, while the
 * estate's audit of record stayed empty. The route is now MAC-only; `server.ts` carries the
 * argument and names precisely what was given up.
 *
 * The constant is DELETED rather than left unreferenced, following `micro-notify`, which deleted
 * its `notify:ingest` rather than registering it after making the same repair. A scope in a
 * service's published vocabulary that no route checks is a capability the vocabulary claims and
 * does not have — and this file exists to make this service's authority auditable.
 *
 * Two orphans outside this repository follow and are REPORTED, not edited from here:
 * `contracts/packages/auth/src/index.ts` still registers `admin:audit:write` in the estate
 * scope vocabulary, and `micro-admin-web`'s README and `src/lib/` still describe the mirror as
 * demanding it. Neither is harmful — an unused scope grants nothing — and neither is this
 * repository's to change.
