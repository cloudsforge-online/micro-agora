 * 18-build-status.md §3.3h records that the estate ships two matchers that disagree, and
 * concludes they are "left as it is, deliberately" because changing an authorisation matcher is
 * the highest-blast-radius edit available here. **Neither package is modified by this
 * repository.** What this file does is prove which reading THIS service uses, and prove that the
