/**
 * Run a mutating operation at most once per key.
 *
 * **The shape is market's** (`market/src/idempotency.ts`), which is the ledger's, which took it
 * from `repos/forge-pay/services/pay/src/store.ts`. It is not reinvented here; it is
 * inherited, because the four properties below are the whole of the correctness and each is easy
 * to lose while writing something that looks equivalent:
 *
 *   1. **The claim INSERT and the work share ONE transaction.** The stored response can therefore
 *      never disagree with what actually committed.
 *   2. **A concurrent duplicate blocks rather than races.** The second INSERT waits on the first
 *      transaction's uncommitted row; when that commits, the duplicate reads the stored response
 *      and replays it.
 *   3. **A reused key with a different body is refused, not replayed.** Returning the first
 *      request's answer to a second, different request is worse than an error: the caller believes
 *      the thing it asked for happened.
 *   4. **A claim with no response yet is "in flight", not "done".**
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **WHY THIS MATTERS ON AN OPERATOR SURFACE, WHICH IS NOT OBVIOUS.**
 *
 * The usual argument is a double-clicked Buy button. Here the artefact is an approval request, and
 * a duplicate one is worse than a duplicate order: two identical pending requests for the same
 * ledger reversal, approved by two different second operators, execute the reversal twice. The
 * ledger's own idempotency would catch the second — `EXECUTORS['ledger.entry.reverse']` derives
 * its key from the approval id, and the two approvals have different ids, so it would NOT. This
 * wrapper is what stops the second request existing at all.
 *
 * `correlationId`, `idempotencyKey` and `requestId` are excluded from the fingerprint. A trace id
 * is SUPPOSED to change on every attempt — the ledger fingerprinted the whole body including it,
 * and so every honest retry would have 409'd in production. That regression is documented in
 * `ledger/src/idempotency.test.ts` and pinned here in both directions.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
