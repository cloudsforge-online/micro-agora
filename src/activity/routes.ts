 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **EVERY HANDLER CLOSES OVER `deps`; NONE TAKES IT AS A PARAMETER.** `createRoutes` is called once
 * with this module's dependency bag and returns specs the kernel can mount without ever seeing the
 * verifier or the ingest secrets. That is what lets the notify module be mounted beside these
 * routes in one process with a bag of its own — see `kernel.ts`.
 *
 * It matters more here than it read in wave M1. The two bags hold DIFFERENT INGEST SECRETS:
 * `ACTIVITY_INGEST_SECRETS` authenticates a write to the canonical record of what happened to a
 * user's money, and `NOTIFY_INGEST_SIGNING_SECRET` authenticates minting a "your key was exported"
 * email. A `deps` parameter threaded by the kernel would have to be a union of the two, which is
 * one spread away from either handler holding the other's key.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **There is no route here that creates a record from a product's request.**
 *
 * AD-11: activity is written only from the event bus. The ingest route takes a signed event
 * envelope, not a feed entry, and the difference is the whole design — a direct write is a write
 * that can happen without the domain change having committed, which is a feed entry describing a
 * transaction that rolled back. If it is not worth an outbox row, it is not worth a feed entry.

/**
 * The two inboxes this process serves, published in the 410 the retired path answers with.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT ONE MOUNT THAT TRIES BOTH SECRET SETS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is the option that looks like compatibility and is a downgrade, on four counts:
 *
 *  1. **It makes each secret a credential for BOTH sinks.** Today `ACTIVITY_INGEST_SECRETS` can
 *     write the canonical record of a user's money and nothing else, and
 *     `NOTIFY_INGEST_SIGNING_SECRET` can mint a security email and nothing else. Accept either on
 *     one mount and whoever holds the weaker or older of the two holds both capabilities. The
 *     estate has already shipped one placeholder outbox key to 44 containers on 54 lines of a
 *     PUBLIC file; that exact event, repeated, would become a write to the money record.
 *  2. **It destroys rotation independence.** Both variables are accept-LISTS precisely so a
 *     rotation is not a flag day. Merged into one acceptance set, retiring one module's outgoing
 *     key silently widens or narrows the other's window, and "which secret is being retired" stops
 *     having an answer.
 *  3. **Nothing in the body says which sink it was for.** The two consumed-topic sets overlap
 *     almost entirely (~84 vs ~86 topics), and an envelope carries a topic, not a destination. One
 *     mount would therefore have to fan every accepted event to BOTH sinks — which would start
 *     notifying people about topics only the feed subscribes to — or guess.
 *  4. **The two handlers do not answer the same thing.** This one replies 201 with a record, or
 *     200 for a duplicate; notify's replies 202 with a pipeline outcome, always. One mount has to
 *     pick, and the loser's producers get a response contract they were not written against.
 *
 * And the failure mode of getting it wrong is silent in the worst direction: a producer configured
 * with the wrong secret would still be answered 2xx, and its events would land in the other
 * module's inbox.
 */

 * It is remounted at `/ingest/analytics` (see `../lantern/analytics/module.ts`) for every one of
 * the four reasons above, read with `analytics` substituted for `notify`: the delivery secrets are
 * capability-scoped to ONE sink, the accept-lists rotate independently, an envelope names a topic
 * and not a destination, and the three handlers answer three different contracts (201/200, 202,
 * and analytics' own).
 *
 * `POST /ingest/client` is deliberately NOT here. It is lantern's browser RUM sink: no signature at
 * all, an origin allowlist instead, and a payload that is not an event envelope. Naming it in this
 * list would send a producer holding a signed delivery at a path that would refuse it for a reason
 * having nothing to do with its key. lantern's own unknown-`/ingest/*` reply names it, where a
