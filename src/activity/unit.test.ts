 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ── THE SENTENCE THAT NAMED A WOUND-DOWN ASSET, AND THE THREE TESTS THAT REPLACE IT ──────────
 *
 * Both reward rules ended `` `You earned ${amount} Shards.` `` — the unit typed into `classify.ts`
 * rather than read off anything — so a player who finished a season read "You earned 250 Shards."
 * in their feed. SHARD is RETIRED (`RETIRED_ASSETS`, `contracts/packages/chain/src/index.ts:58`)
 * and nothing may be newly denominated in it. micro-org #227 is the estate sweep; this repository
 * is one row of seven.
 *
 * **No test pinned that string, which is its own finding.** micro-notify's did — `catalogue.test.ts`
 * asserted `params['rewardName'] === '250 Shards'` under the name "names the Shards", so its suite
 * was green BECAUSE of the defect and any correction to the copy turned it red. Nothing here was
 * locked in the same way; these two summaries were simply never asserted at all, by 92 tests that
 * covered every neighbouring rule. An unasserted user-visible sentence is the cheaper version of
 * the same failure, and it is what the three tests below close:
 *
 *   1. with no asset code on the event — which is every real event today — no unit is rendered and
 *      BOTH rules render the same sentence, because they now share `seasonRewardSummary`;
 *   2. with an asset code on the event, the code rendered is the one the payload named, so the
 *      unit is derived and not chosen here;
 *   3. no summary this build can produce names a retired asset — asserted against `RETIRED_ASSETS`
 *      itself rather than against the word "Shards", so it extends itself the next time an asset
 *      is wound down, and driven over every registered topic rather than over these two.
 *
 * The payloads are the producers' real ones, read at the emit sites: `worlds/src/rewards.ts:555-574`
 * and `emberkin/src/seasons.ts:136-142`. Neither carries an asset code. Both services nevertheless
 * credit the player in SHARD (`rewardPostings`, `worlds/src/ledgerclient.ts:155-183` and
 * `emberkin/src/ledgerclient.ts:116-141`), which is why "EMBER" would have been a worse fix than
 * the defect: a unit this service invented on behalf of the one that moved the money.
