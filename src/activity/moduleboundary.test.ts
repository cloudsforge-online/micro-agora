/**
 * Each module's credentials are reachable from that module and from nowhere else.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT READS SOURCE.**
 *
 * Wave M2 put two services in one process. Before it, the thing keeping
 * `ACTIVITY_INGEST_SECRETS` and `NOTIFY_INGEST_SIGNING_SECRET` from being interchangeable was that
 * they lived in different processes — and the difference between them is not academic:
 *
 *   * activity's key authenticates a write to the canonical record of what happened to a user's
 *     money.
 *   * notify's key authenticates an event that mints a "your key was exported" email to any address
 *     on file — the most convincing phishing message this estate is capable of sending.
 *
 * Neither should be able to do the other's job. `SMTP_PASS` and `NOTIFY_GATEWAY_TOKEN` are in the
 * same position: live credentials that now share a heap with a service that has no business
 * holding them.
 *
 * A process boundary enforced all of that for free. A module boundary does not — one heap, one
 * import graph, and one careless `deps` spread away from an activity handler closing over notify's
 * signing key.
 *
 * **The defect this guards is an OMISSION, and an omission has no behaviour to test.** Nothing
 * observable changes the day somebody adds `ingestSigningSecrets` to activity's `ServerDeps`: every
 * test still passes, every route still answers, and the boundary is simply gone. So this asserts
 * the SHAPE of the source — the same reasoning `notify/topics.test.ts` records for the same class
 * of failure, and the same reasoning that made `ownnetwork.test.ts` a source assertion.
 *
 * **It is written so it cannot pass by finding nothing.** The `the detector is looking at real
 * code` block is what fails when a scanner is pointed at a moved file or a regex stops matching —
 * which is exactly what happened to `notify/catalogue.test.ts`'s producer seam in this very wave,
 * and to `analytics/routeidempotency.test.ts` in the one before it.
