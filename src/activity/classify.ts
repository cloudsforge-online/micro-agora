/**
 * Turning an event into a feed entry.
 *
 * AD-11: activity subscribes to **every** domain topic and keeps the narrative. The table below
 * is that word "every" made checkable — it is declared as
 * `satisfies Readonly<Record<TopicName, TopicClassifier>>`, so a topic added to
 * `@cloudsforge/contracts-events` and not classified here **fails to compile**. That is the
 * property worth having: the alternative is a topic that quietly lands in `unclassified` for six
 * months because nobody remembered this file existed.
 *
 * ## What a classifier may and may not do
 *
 * It may read the envelope. It may not read the database, call another service, or fail. A
 * classifier that threw would turn a delivered event into a 500 and a redelivery loop, and the
 * producer would keep retrying an event that will never be accepted. Every field below therefore
 * has a fallback, and every string taken from a payload is length-capped before it reaches a
 * summary — a summary is rendered in a user's feed and an uncapped one is a stored-XSS surface
 * with a nice name.
 *
 * ## Why `subject_urn` rather than a foreign key
 *
 * 04-domain-model §11: no cross-service foreign keys. The owning service owns the record; this
 * one holds a reference by URN and resolves it by asking, if it ever needs to. A feed that joined
 * to another service's table would be a feed that cannot be read while that service is down.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ── THE PRODUCERS WHOSE `amount` IS SMALLEST UNITS, AND THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH ─────────────────
 *
 * A payload field called `amount` is not a unit. Half the estate spells a decimal figure with
 * that name and half spells an integer count of the asset's indivisible units with it, and the
 * two differ by up to eighteen orders of magnitude with nothing on the wire to tell them apart:
 * `2.5` and `2500000000000000000` are both `/^\d+(\.\d+)?$/`, and neither carries a `decimals`.
 *
 * A classifier may not read a database (see the header), so this file cannot convert. What it CAN
 * do is know which producers speak which dialect, because the producer is on the envelope and the
 * topic namespace is the ownership boundary — `contracts-events` already refuses an event whose
 * producer does not own its topic, so `envelope.producer` is as trustworthy as the topic name.
 *
 * The set is keyed on the PRODUCER rather than on a list of topics deliberately: a wallet topic
 * registered tomorrow is smallest units on the day it lands, and a topic list would have to be
 * remembered. This is the same argument as the `satisfies Record<TopicName, …>` above — make the
 * default safe, rather than trusting the next person to add a line.
 *
 *   - `wallet`      — `toWithdrawal` stores `amount: row.amount` and separately computes
 *                     `formatAmount(BigInt(row.amount), decimals)` (`wallet/src/withdrawals.ts`);
 *                     `wallet/src/deposits.ts` emits the same pair. The raw side is the
 *                     one named `amount`.
 *   - `settlement`  — `units()` refuses anything but `/^\d+$/` and calls it "a decimal string of
 *                     smallest units" (`settlement/src/withdrawals.ts`); `base(row)` puts
 *                     `row.amount.toString()` on every outbound payload (`withdrawals.ts`).
 *   - `ledger`      — `postings.amount` is `numeric(78,0)` (`ledger/src/migrations.ts`), an
 *                     integer column with no fractional part to hold a decimal in.
 *   - `market`      — `orders.amount` and `bids.amount` are `numeric(78,0)` too
 *                     (`market/src/migrations.ts,402`), and `orderEventPayload` emits
 *                     `order.amount.toString()` (`market/src/orders.ts`).
 *   - `trade`       — joined with micro-org#345, and the best-evidenced of the five. Every money
 *                     column in `trade/src/migrations.ts` is `numeric(78,0)` — allocation, cash,
 *                     equity, high_water_mark, fee_owed, fee_paid, shards, collected — and
 *                     `trade/src/money.ts` is `bigint` throughout with a header that exists
 *                     because the service it replaces read every one of those columns into a
 *                     JavaScript `number`. Its three units are named there and all three are
 *                     integers: Shards (no sub-unit at all, 100 to the USD), base units, and a
 *                     price scaled by `RATE_SCALE`. There is no decimal on any trade payload.
 *
 * Adding a producer here is a one-line change and removing one needs the same kind of citation.

 * **A figure that may be shown to a person as money, or null when there is not one.**

 * The only reader a summary or the `amount` COLUMN may use. `amount()` above answers "what number
 * is on the payload"; this answers the question that actually matters, "what number may be
 * rendered beside an asset code", and those are not the same question.
 *
 * Three outcomes, in order:
 *
 * 1. **The producer already converted it.** `<field>Formatted` is the estate's spelling for the
 *    decimal side of the pair — wallet emits `amount`/`amountFormatted` together and only wallet
 *    knows the asset's `decimals`, because only wallet can call `chainSpec`. Where it is on the
 *    payload it is authoritative and it is used.
 * 2. **The producer deals in smallest units and did not convert it.** Null — "not stated". Not a
 *    guess at eighteen decimals, which is right for EMBER and SHARD and wrong for USDC, and not
 *    the raw integer either. This is the refusal `tessera.venue.booked` and

 *
 * ── WHY THE `amount` COLUMN GOES THROUGH THIS TOO, WHICH IS A REVERSAL ────────────────────────
 *
 * Two comments below used to say the figure "still reaches the record's own columns, where it is
 * typed and not prose", and treated the column as a safe place to put a number of unknown scale.
 * **That was wrong, and there is a file that proves it:** `hub-web/src/pages/activity.tsx,202`
 * renders `formatAmount(record.amount)` immediately followed by `record.assetCode`, and
 * `hub-web/src/lib/format.ts` is a DECIMAL formatter with a thousands separator. So a
 * smallest-units integer in that column is not typed data at rest — it is
 * "2,500,000,000,000,000,000 SHARD" in the same feed row as the summary, one hop later. The
 * column is prose with extra steps, so it gets the prose rule.
 *
 * Nothing is silently lost by that: every classifier that cares declares `amount` in its
 * `payloadKeys`, so the producer's own figure survives verbatim in `activity_records.payload`,
 * where it is a labelled field in a JSON document and no frontend renders it as money.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ── WHAT A SEASON REWARD IS CALLED, AND WHY THE UNIT IS NOT WRITTEN INTO THE SENTENCE ─────────
 *
 * Both reward rules — `worlds.reward.granted` and `emberkin.reward.granted` — used to end
 *
 *     `You earned ${amount} Shards.`
 *
 * with the unit typed into the copy. SHARD is RETIRED: `RETIRED_ASSETS = Object.freeze(['SHARD'])`
 * (`contracts/packages/chain/src/index.ts:58`), whose own comment is that nothing may be **newly**
 * denominated in it — and a season reward is exactly a new denomination, announced to the player
 * who has just been given it. micro-org #227 is the sweep that found this; it spans seven
 * repositories and it is the third time a retired asset has reached a user surface (#15, #182).
 *
 * ── WHAT THE PRODUCERS ACTUALLY PUT ON THE WIRE, READ AT BOTH EMIT SITES ──────────────────────
 *
 *   - `worlds/src/rewards.ts:555-574` (`grantReward`) emits `{ rewardId, seasonId, titleId,
 *     userId, reason, amountShards, journalEntryId, budgetRemainingShards }`.
 *   - `emberkin/src/seasons.ts:136-142` (`grantSeasonReward`) emits `{ seasonId, userId, reason,
 *     amount, journalEntryId }`.
 *
 * **Neither carries an asset code.** The old sentence did not read one either — "Shards" was a
 * word in THIS file, and the only thing on either payload pointing at an asset was the NAME of
 * worlds' `amountShards` field. A field name is the producer's wire contract and no person ever
 * reads it; a summary is read by a person. Those are not the same claim, which is why reading a
 * field called `amountShards` below is not the defect being closed here.
 *
 * ── AND THE OBVIOUS SUBSTITUTION — EMBER FOR SHARDS — WOULD HAVE BEEN A WORSE LINE ────────────
 *
 * Both services credit the player in SHARD today, at HEAD: `rewardPostings` builds every posting
 * with `assetCode: 'SHARD'` against `engagementAccount(<programme>, 'SHARD')` —
 * `worlds/src/ledgerclient.ts:155-183`, `emberkin/src/ledgerclient.ts:116-141`. So "You earned
 * 250 EMBER." would be a feed row the ledger contradicts, and a unit this service picked on
 * behalf of the service that moved the money. Where the engagement programmes re-denominate is
 * #226 and it is theirs to decide. #227's own later paragraph is the accurate description of
 * these two lines: surfaces labelling "genuinely SHARD-denominated ledger data … need the
 * underlying re-denomination, not a find-and-replace".
 *
 * ── SO: AN AMOUNT AND A CODE THE PRODUCER SENT, OR NO UNIT AND NO FIGURE ──────────────────────
 *
 * A quantity with no unit is not a smaller version of the truth. "You earned 250." is a number
 * the reader supplies their own unit for — the same shape `money`'s header above refuses for
 * scale and `settlement.sweep.completed` refuses longhand. So the figure travels with its unit or
 * it does not travel: an amount AND an asset code the producer sent, else the sentence that names
 * the reward without quantifying it. Nothing is lost that was ever knowable here — both payloads
 * declare their amount field, so the producer's own figure survives verbatim in
 * `activity_records.payload`, in its own units, where it is a labelled field rather than money.
 *
 * The asset-code branch is DEAD against both of today's payloads and is written anyway. It is
 * what makes this outlive #226: the day either producer puts `assetCode` on its event both
 * summaries begin reading "250 EMBER" with no edit here, and no unit will ever have been typed
 * into this file to get there. Same shape as `wallet.withdrawal.requested`, which declines a
 * figure until wallet emits `amountFormatted` and then prints it with no change in this file.
 *
 * ── A RETIRED CODE IS REFUSED EVEN WHEN THE PRODUCER DOES SEND IT, WHICH IS A JUDGEMENT ───────
 *
 * Elsewhere in this file rendering SHARD is CORRECT: `wallet.deposit.confirmed` says "A SHARD
 * deposit was confirmed and credited." from the code on its payload, because a deposit is a past
 * fact that really was denominated that way — the argument that also keeps
 * `mint-web/src/lib/format.ts` showing a pre-migration order as "2,500 SHARD". A reward is not
 * that. It is news about something a player has just been given, in an asset the estate is
 * winding down. So this ONE reader consults `RETIRED_ASSETS` — the estate's LIST, never the
 * string "SHARD", so it extends itself the next time an asset is retired.
 *
 * ── ONE FUNCTION, BECAUSE THE TWO RULES DISAGREEING IS PART OF WHAT #227 REPORTS ──────────────
 *
 * micro-notify's row of #227 reaches the same answer for the same two topics from the other side
 * of the bus, independently: `rewardNameOf` (`notify/src/catalogue.ts:521`, on that repository's
 * `fix/reward-name-derives-its-unit`) renders "a reward" where this renders "You earned a season
 * reward.", refuses a retired code on the delivery path, and carries the same dead asset-code
 * branch. Two services describing one event in two different denominations is how a player's feed
 * and their email end up disagreeing, and it is what #227 §2 reports about this pair: notify
 * appended "Shards" on emberkin's rule and nothing at all on worlds'. Neither was a decision;
 * each was what its author wrote on the day.
 *
 * `amountField` is a parameter rather than a probe of every spelling, and that is the allowlist
 * rather than taste: a classifier may not read a payload key it has not declared, and reading
 * emberkin's `amount` on worlds' topic — or worlds' `amountShards` on emberkin's — either fails
 * that test or forces a declaration claiming a payload carries a field it does not. `assetCode`
 * needs no such parameter: it is one of the generic keys `classify` already probes on every
 * topic for the record's own column.
 *
 * ── ONE THING THIS DOES NOT FIX, RECORDED RATHER THAN SMUGGLED IN ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * emberkin's `amount` still reaches the record's `amount` COLUMN through `money` — emberkin is
 * not a smallest-units producer — while its `assetCode` column stays null, and
 * `hub-web/src/pages/activity.tsx:207-213` renders the figure with an empty code beside it. That
 * is a figure without a unit one column to the right of the one repaired here, and it is the same
 * hole: it closes when the producers name their asset, which is #226's re-denomination, not a
 * classifier's to invent.

 *
 * The actor is *who performed the act*, and the feed record belongs to *whose news it is*. Those
 * coincide often enough to be tempting and diverge exactly where it costs the most:
 * `aetherholm.battle.resolved` has the ATTACKER as its actor while the record is the DEFENDER's
 * (see that entry), and `market.listing.sold`'s offer event had the OFFERER as its actor, which is
 * why `notify` refuses the generic helper there and reads `sellerSubject` explicitly. Reaching for
 * this reader because a payload is thin is how "your city was raided" lands in the raider's feed.
 *
 * It is used by exactly six topics — `trade.bot.created`, `trade.bot.started`, `trade.bot.paused`,
 * `trade.fee.settled`, `devplatform.key.issued` and `devplatform.key.revoked` — and each one cites
 * the site in its producer that proves the actor is the subject of the news rather than merely its
 * cause. Nothing else may use it without doing the same, and `unit.test.ts`'s actor rule holds every
 * other topic in the registry to that refusal.
 *
 * **trade's four are the easy case and it is worth saying why, so the next author does not read
 * them as a precedent for the hard one.** All four take their actor from the BOT ROW rather than
 * from the caller — `bots.ts` and `fees.ts` build it from `bot.userId`, not from the session — so
 * the actor is the owner whoever pressed the button and whatever route reached the emit. That is a
 * different and much stronger claim than "the person who acted is usually the person affected",
 * which is the claim that fails on `aetherholm.battle.resolved`. trade's other three topics do NOT
 * qualify, and `trade.fill.settled` stopped qualifying for a DIFFERENT reason than it used to. It
 * was emitted with no actor at all until micro-trade `ee5e189`, so there was nothing on the
 * envelope to read; it now emits `user:${fill.userId}` off the fill row, the same shape as the four
 * above, and it still does not use this reader — because that same change put `userId` on the
 * payload, and a payload that names the user needs no argument at all. That is the rule this reader
 * is quarantined by, stated in the direction that matters: `userFromActor` is what a topic falls
 * back to when the payload names nobody, not the better answer when both are available.
 * `trade.order.filled` and `trade.transfer.settled` are the same case and always were.
 *
 * `parseActor` from contracts-events rather than a `startsWith('user:')`, because the actor
 * vocabulary is the contract's and this file must not hold a second opinion about it. That is not
 * hypothetical: `devplatform` shipped `key:<display>` and `system:identity`, two spellings the
 * contract has never admitted (`ActorKind` is `user | service | operator | system`, and `system`
 * takes no subject), and a local prefix test would have read both as "not a user" for the right
 * answer by luck rather than refused them as illegal.
 *
 * The UUID check on top is not redundant. `parseActor` accepts any non-empty subject, so
 * `user:alice` parses; a non-uuid subject reaching `activity_records.user_id` is a value no feed
 * query can ever match, which is the silent-misfile failure this file exists to avoid.

   * A DIFFERENT FACT from `settlement.withdrawal.stuck`, which is why both names stay.
   *
   * The registry carries both and they are not two spellings of one event:
   *
   *   * `settlement.withdrawal.stuck` — settlement's, keyed `chain:network`. An outbound
   *     transaction was BROADCAST and has not confirmed. Classified above as `withdrawal.stuck`,
   *     and it frequently has no user on it, which is why it is demoted to internal so often.
   *   * `wallet.withdrawal.stuck` — this one, wallet's, keyed `withdrawal_id`. A withdrawal sat in
   *     `queued` or `settling` past `WALLET_WITHDRAWAL_STUCK_MINUTES` with **no word from
   *     settlement at all** (`wallet/src/withdrawals.ts`). Nothing is known to have been
   *     broadcast; it may never have left. It always names the user, because `sweepStuck` selects
   *     `user_id` off the row.
   *
   * So the `type` differs too. Collapsing them onto `withdrawal.stuck` would hand the frontend one
   * icon for "we are waiting on a chain" and "we have lost track of your withdrawal", and would make
   * the operator query "which of these never got as far as a transaction" unanswerable from the
   * feed. `settlement.withdrawal.stuck` keeps the name it already has, in already-written rows.
   *
   * `user`-visible, and unlike settlement's it will actually stay that way. The money is reserved
   * and unspendable, and a balance a user cannot spend and cannot explain is named in wallet's own
   * comment as forge-pay's failure mode. The summary says the amount is still held, because the
   * one thing that must not happen is a user reading this and believing it has been returned —

   * A sweep is an INTERNAL custody movement, and this is the judgement call in the three.
   *
   * A sweep empties a user's per-address deposit balance into the pinned treasury address
   * (`settlement/src/sweeps.ts`). The case for showing it to the user is real and worth stating
   * before refusing it: this is the one event in the estate that says customer funds crossed into
   * the blast radius of the signing credential, and "money of mine moved somewhere I did not ask
   * it to move" sounds exactly like something a person is entitled to read.
   *
   * It is refused on three grounds, in increasing order of how much they matter.
   *
   * 1. There is no user on the event. The payload (`sweeps.ts`) is
   *    `{ outboundId, sweepSourceId, chain, network, assetCode, from, to, amount, fee, txHash,
   *    confirmedAt }`. The owner exists but only in a table: `sweep_sources.custody_user_id`,
   *    which settlement itself has to go and read (`sweepBindingFor`, `sweeps.ts`). A
   *    classifier may not read a database — see the header — so a user-visible answer here would
   *    have to be invented, and `classify` would demote it to internal regardless.
   * 2. **Nothing about the user's position changes.** The user's claim on the platform was
   *    credited at `wallet.deposit.confirmed`, which is already in their feed as
   *    `deposit.confirmed`. A sweep moves platform-controlled funds between two
   *    platform-controlled addresses; the balance, the entitlement and the ledger position are all
   *    exactly what they were a moment before. A timeline entry whose true content is "no change
   *    occurred" is not a disclosure, it is an alarm the reader can do nothing with — and one
   *    phrased in terms of an address they never chose and a treasury they have no relationship
   *    with.
   * 3. It is somebody's news, just not the account holder's. Where a sweep genuinely matters is
   *    reconciliation: `ledger.reconciliation.completed` compares totals with nothing telling it
   *    which movements produced them, and this is that missing input. So it files under `wallet`
   *    and `internal` — the same home as `wallet.reconciliation_completed` — because the two
   *    records an operator has to read together should sit under one filter. That is the argument
   *    that put sign-IN and sign-OUT both under `security`, applied to treasury accounting.
   *
   * The summary deliberately carries no amount. `row.amount` is smallest units
   * (`settlement/src/withdrawals.ts`, `chains.ts`), the payload does not say how many
   * decimals the asset has, and a rendered figure that is off by eighteen orders of magnitude is
   * worse for the operator reading it than no figure at all.
   *
   * **This block used to end "`assetCode` and `amount` still reach the record's own columns
   * through `classify`, where they are typed and not prose", and that second half was wrong.**
   * `hub-web/src/pages/activity.tsx` prints `formatAmount(record.amount)` next to
   * `record.assetCode`, so the column is rendered as money one hop later — the argument written
   * here to keep the figure out of the prose applies to it unchanged. `assetCode` still reaches
   * its column; the figure is kept in the stored payload, in its own units. `money` has the full
   * reasoning and now applies it to every topic rather than to the ones somebody remembered.

   * compile. That compile error was the cheap half of the fault. The expensive half is that
   * `classify` dereferences `CLASSIFIERS[topic]` for any topic the registry knows
   * (`classify.ts`, the `known` branch), so an unclassified-but-registered topic is a `TypeError`
   * inside the ingest transaction — a 500, no inbox row, and a relay that redelivers the same
   * event for ever against a service that can never accept it. A missing classifier is not a
   * cosmetic gap; it is a delivery loop.
   *
   * **All three are keyed by a uuid that is not a user** — `bot_id`, `key_id`, `key_id` — so
   * `userFromKey` returns a real, well-formed, wrong id on every one of them — the
   * `identity.session.created` misattribution again, on three more topics. `unit.test.ts`'s
   * key-reader rule covers all three the moment the registry names them, because it is written
   * against the registry's `keyedBy` rather than against a list somebody has to remember to
   * extend.
   *
   * **And all three carry no user in the payload either**, so `userFromPayload` — the repair that
   * worked for settlement's, wallet's and identity's — finds nothing here:
   *
   *   - `trade/src/bots.ts`, the sole `trade.bot.paused` emit, sends `{ botId }`.

   *     `{ keyId, projectId, environment, display, lookupId, reason }`.
   *
   * The owner is on the ENVELOPE, in `actor`, and only reading it there gets these three into the
   * right feed. See `userFromActor` for why that reader is quarantined to exactly these topics and
   * what it costs when it is used anywhere else. `notify` reached the same conclusion from the

   *
   * Every one of these four corresponds to a ledger entry, and all four spent the life of the
   * service in `unclassified` — which cost more than the missing feed rows. `unclassified` maps to
   * the `quarantine` retention class, 90 days, while a `trading` or `transfer` record is
   * `financial` at 1825. Four topics' worth of money movement was being deleted at three months
   * because nobody had written a classifier, and the pruner was doing exactly what it was told.
   *
   * **`trade` joins `SMALLEST_UNIT_PRODUCERS` in the same change, and that is load-bearing.** Every
   * figure on these four payloads is an integer count: `trade/src/money.ts` is `bigint` throughout
   * with a header that names the float-money defect it exists to close, and every money column in
   * `trade/src/migrations.ts` is `numeric(78,0)`. Without that line, `money` would put a raw Shard
   * count in the `amount` column and `hub-web`'s decimal formatter would render it with thousands
   * separators as if it were a decimal figure. See `money`'s own header — the column is prose with
   * extra steps.
   *
   * The consequence is that NONE of the four prints a figure today, and the summaries are written
   * to be worth reading without one. Each of them carries what the reader cannot get elsewhere: an
   * asset code, a direction, a market, or the fact that the platform charged them.
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
  /**
   * **EMITTED SINCE micro-trade `ee5e189`, and this classifier predates the emit deliberately.**
   *
   * What stood here until that landed was the measurement rather than a complaint: `applyFill` and
   * `settleFill` each took an OPTIONAL `emit`, neither of `tickBot`'s two call sites — the paper
   * branch and the live one — ever passed one, and zero `trade.fill.settled` had reached this
   * service or the mainnet `trade.outbox` in the life of the service. The classifier was written
   * against a topic nothing sent on the argument that a classifier for a topic no producer sends is
   * the same defect as a producer no classifier covers, and only the second has a compile error to
   * announce it. That bet paid: the emit was wired up in trade with no edit needed on this side, so
   * the first fill this service ever sees will be classified rather than quarantined. It has not
   * seen one yet — `activity_records` holds zero rows on ANY `trade.%` topic on either network,
   * counted 2026-08-12 — which is the state this classifier was always written for.
   *
   * trade closed it by making the argument REQUIRED rather than by passing the optional one, so a
   * third call site that forgets it is a compile error in trade instead of another silence here.
   * Both branches of `tickBot` publish, including the paper one — see the `entryId` note below,
   * which is the reason a simulated fill is worth a record at all.
   *
   * **`userFromPayload` and `payloadKeys: ['userId', …]` are LIVE readers now, not aspirational
   * ones.** They were written against a payload that did not carry the field — `FillRecord.userId`
   * existed on the row `applyFill` returns and `settleFill` already passed it to `fillPostings`,
   * but nothing put it on the wire — so every fill would have been demoted to `internal` by
   * `classify`'s own owner check, which is the right answer when a classifier cannot find an owner
   * and may not query a database to look one up. `ee5e189` put `userId` on the payload. The fills
   * are `user`-visible records in their owner's feed from that commit forward, and the branch that
   * used to be dead is the one that runs.
   *
   * **The envelope now names an actor too, and this reader still takes the PAYLOAD.** The emit
   * passes `user:${fill.userId}` off the same row it reads `userId` from, so the two agree by
   * construction and neither is a guess — but the payload is the reader that needs no citation, and
   * `userFromActor` is quarantined to the six topics whose payload names nobody (see its header).

   * yes here for the same sentence.
   *
   * **Neither figure can be shown and the summary does not pretend otherwise.** `collected` and
   * `due` are cent counts — smallest units, so `money` declines both — and neither is spelled
   * `amount`, so neither reaches the `amount` column either. Everything below is therefore written
   * to carry the FACT without the number, which is the constraint the whole of trade's block works
   * under and the reason `status` rather than `due - collected` is what this entry reads.
   *
   * **Two facts, and `status` is the discriminator — as of micro-trade `ee5e189`.** What stood here
   * was the opposite claim, and it was true when it was written: the payload was
   * `{ settlementId, botId, period, collected, entryId }`, `status` was a column on trade's own row
   * and on nothing that crossed the wire, and a wallet that covered a twentieth of the fee produced
   * a byte-identical event to one that covered all of it. This rule and notify's wrote that limit
   * down against themselves on 2026-08-10 rather than hedging the copy — "a sentence that says
   * 'some or all of a fee' is worse than one that says a fee was charged" — and trade sent `status`
   * and `due` instead, which is the repair those two notes were asking for.
   *
   * A partial collection is not a smaller version of the same news. The customer's balance did not
   * cover the assessment, `settleFee` writes the shortfall back to `feeOwed`, and the next period's
   * `due` is `fee + feeOwed` — so the money is still owed and will be taken. A reader told "a
   * performance fee was charged" has been told the matter is closed when it is not, and will next
   * see a settlement that takes more than one period's fee with nothing in the feed explaining why.
   * That is why this gets a `type` of its own and not just a second sentence: `type` is what a
   * frontend switches an icon and an emphasis on, and the two entries above (`trade.bot.started`'s
   * reservation and `trade.order.filled`'s side) split on exactly this test — a field of the
   * payload separating two messages a reader must not confuse. `devplatform.key.issued` refuses the
   * split for the complementary reason, that its distinction is already carried by `visibility`;
   * nothing else on this record carries the difference between a fee taken and a fee half taken.
   *
   * **`uncollectable` cannot arrive here and the code must not pretend it can.** `settleFee` emits
   * inside `if (collected > 0n)` and that guard deliberately stayed: an uncollectable settlement
   * moved no money at all, and publishing it on a topic whose consumers render a charge would be a
   * charge that did not happen. So the branch below is binary by construction, and the fallback is
   * the charged sentence rather than a third one — a status this producer cannot send is not worth
   * a message no user can ever be shown. A bot in arrears having no event of its own is a real gap
   * and it is trade's to close with a topic of its own, filed on micro-org#367.

   * The org path's actor is `service:identity`, so `userFromActor` returns null and `classify`
   * demotes the record to internal — correct, because there genuinely is no user on the envelope
   * and a classifier may not read a database to find one. The owner exists: `api_keys.created_by`
   * is on the row `revokeOrgKeys` is already updating. The repair is one field on devplatform's
   * payload, and it is filed for micro-devplatform. `notify` cannot close it either — `forUser`
   * answers `no_recipient` for a `service:` actor and that refusal is correct — so today a mass
   * revocation is an operator's record and nobody's notification.
   *
   * Both branches key off `userFromActor(event) !== null` rather than off `parseActor` again, so
   * the type and the owner can never disagree: there is exactly one reader, and "the platform did
   * this" means precisely "no user is attributed" rather than approximately.

   * `actor: subject` on almost all fourteen, so `userFromActor` would work today and would be the
   * wrong instrument: the actor is who acted, and half of this producer's events are acts performed
   * ON somebody. `agora.voice.suspended` is the standing proof — its actor is the OPERATOR — and a
   * classifier that reached for the actor because the payload looked thin would file a suspension
   * in the moderator's timeline instead of the suspended person's. agora names the person on the
   * payload precisely so that no consumer has to make that judgement; see its emit sites, which say
   * so in those words.
   *
   * **A voice id is not a user id.** `voiceId`, `authorId`, `followeeId`, `barredId` and
   * `createdBy` are all agora's own identifiers for a person and mean nothing to this service or to
   * `activity_records.user_id`; writing one there would produce a row no feed query can ever match.
   * That is why every entry below reads `subject` and none of them reads a voice.
   *
   * **The second party is never named.** A follow, a bar and a spark all involve two people, and
   * only the actor's record is written here — the other party learns of it from agora's own
   * notifications, which is where a fact about a stranger's account belongs. So `followeeId`,
   * `barredId` and `authorId` are undeclared and dropped at ingest, not stored "in case".
   *
   * **Two topics are owned by nobody, deliberately.** `agora.report.filed` never names its
   * reporter — agora refuses to put it on the bus, so nothing can be attributed — and
   * `agora.whisper.sent` carries no subject either, because "who messaged whom, and when" is the
   * metadata of a private conversation and a second service holding it is exactly the copy the
   * whole design avoids. Both are `internal` with a null owner: the event is still recorded, which
   * is the difference between a fact nobody owns and a fact nobody kept.
