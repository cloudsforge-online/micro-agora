/**
 * Two modules, two migration ledgers, and the check that keeps them from becoming one.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS IS NOT A CRASH.**
 *
 * `@cloudsforge/db` records applied migrations in a table called `schema_migrations`. The name is a
 * literal in that package and takes no option, so two modules migrating ONE database write into one
 * ledger keyed by `version` — and both modules number their migrations from 1.
 *
 * Whichever runs first records versions 1..N; the second then finds those rows, treats its OWN
 * 1..N as already applied, creates none of its tables, and the migrator exits 0. The deploy goes
 * green. The service refuses to serve at the next boot's schema assertion, naming a version rather
 * than the cause.
 *
 * Nothing downstream catches it. The advisory locks are derived from the SERVICE name and the two
 * names differ, so the two runs do not even serialise against each other.
 *
 * And it matters more for this pair than it did for wave M1's. lantern and analytics both owned a
 * table called `events` — with DIFFERENT columns, so a shared database would at least have failed
 * on conflicting DDL. activity and notify both own a table called `inbox` with IDENTICAL columns,
 * and both own a `jobs`. `the two schemas really do collide` below measures that rather than
 * asserting it from memory, because the whole argument for this check rests on it.
