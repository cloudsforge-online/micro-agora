/**
 * Configuration, validated at import.
 *
 * Rule 9 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2 — "a repo declares the variables it needs; the deploy provides
 * exactly those" — is a property of this file. Every variable the service reads is named here and
 * nowhere else, so the deploy manifest can be derived from it and `env_file: .env` fan-out (which
 * hands every container the whole estate's secrets) has nothing to justify it.
 *
 * Two behaviours are copied deliberately from the estate's custody service, which is the only
 * place that gets this right today:
 *
 *   1. **A missing variable names itself.** `undefined` propagating into a connection string
 *      surfaces four layers later as an unreadable driver error.
 *   2. **A known placeholder is refused outright.** A default secret in source is not convenient,
 *      it is catastrophic: everything derived from it is forgeable by anyone who can read the
 *      repository, and a placeholder that boots is a placeholder that reaches production.

/**
 * The ingest secrets, newest first.
 *
 * A **list**, because rotation must not require every producer in the estate and this service to
 * change in the same instant. `verifyDelivery` in contracts-events tries each candidate and
 * reports which one matched, so an operator publishes the new secret, both are accepted for a
 * window, and then the old one is removed. A single-secret variable would make every rotation an
 * outage, which is how a secret ends up never being rotated at all.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE PER-ENTRY `PLACEHOLDERS` SET AND 24-CHARACTER FLOOR USED TO LIVE HERE, AND THEY ARE GONE
 * RATHER THAN KEPT IN FRONT OF THE SHAPE CHECK.**
 *
 * `ACTIVITY_INGEST_SECRETS` is one of the seven names the estate spells a single shared HMAC key
 * under, and that key sat in a PUBLIC compose file as `estate-only-outbox-secret-00000000000000`
 * on 54 lines. The old rule here — a fixed deny-list of exact strings plus a 24-character floor —
 * could not have refused it: 40 characters, and on nobody's list. A check that could not fail read
 * as the absence of a problem, which is worse than no check at all (micro-org #142).
 *
 * A deny-list of exact strings cannot work, because the next placeholder somebody writes is by
 * definition not on it. `assertGeneratedSecretList` asserts what a placeholder cannot have, per
 * entry: the base64 or hex alphabet (no hyphens — every placeholder this estate wrote had one), 32
 * decoded BYTES rather than 24 keystrokes, and a measured Shannon entropy floor. Every string the
 * old set held is refused by that anyway, and running the weaker rule first would answer a
 * 40-character placeholder with "must be at least 24 characters" — true, useless, and about the
 * wrong property.
 *
 * **Every entry, including the outgoing one.** In a rotation overlap window the outgoing key is the
 * one an attacker already holds if it leaked, and "just for the drain" is exactly how a placeholder
 * survives the rotation meant to remove it.
 *
 * This is the check that stands between an unauthenticated POST and the canonical record of what
 * happened to a user's money, so there is no NODE_ENV exemption and no escape hatch. What is kept
 * is what the shape check does not know about: this service's own empty and four-deep refusals,
 * whose messages name the variable and this service.
