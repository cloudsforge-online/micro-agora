/**
 * The versioned schema.
 *
 * Rule 7 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: versioned files, run by a one-shot job under an advisory lock,
 * expand/contract only. Nothing here is executed by `index.ts` — `src/migrator.ts` is the only
 * caller, and the service asserts the version rather than reaching it.
 *
 * **A released migration is immutable.** `@cloudsforge/db` checksums each one and refuses a run
 * where the text changed after it was applied. The fix for a wrong migration is always a new one.
 *
 * ## Why there is an `inbox` but no `outbox`
 *
 * Activity is a pure consumer. AD-11 puts it downstream of every domain topic and it produces
 * none of its own — `contracts-events` registers no `activity.*` topic, so there is nothing this
 * service is entitled to publish. An outbox table here would come with a relay job, a signing
 * secret in the deploy and a permanently empty dashboard panel.
 *
 * The `inbox` is the opposite: it is the whole mechanism by which at-least-once delivery becomes
 * effectively-once handling, and 04-domain-model §10.6 specifies it as `(topic, event_id)`.
 *
 * ## Why the unique constraint on `source_event_id` as well
 *
 * They are not redundant and they are not two dedupes that can disagree, because they are written
 * in one transaction. The inbox row is the *handler-once* guard, generic and owned by §10.6. The
 * unique constraint is the *table invariant* from §10.1 — "source_event_id is unique, so a
 * redelivered event does not duplicate a feed entry" — and it is the one that still holds if a
 * future code path writes a record by some other route. A constraint that only exists in
 * application logic is a constraint that holds until the second caller.

     * STORAGE LIMITATION, PUT IN THE SCHEMA RATHER THAN IN A HANDLER.

     * `src/retention.ts` holds the four periods and the basis for each; this migration is the half
     * of it that survives the application being wrong. The distinction that matters: a period
     * enforced only by a job stops existing the moment the job breaks, and it breaks silently,
     * whereas a column the database fills in itself is a column every row has.
     *
     * Postgres cannot delete rows on a schedule of its own, so this does not pretend to. What it
     * guarantees is everything up to the deletion:
     *
     *   * every row carries a `retention_class`, because a BEFORE INSERT trigger assigns it — an
     *     application that forgot, or a future writer that never knew, cannot produce a row without
     *     one;
     *   * it is NOT NULL and CHECK-constrained to the four names, so it cannot hold a fifth;
     *   * it cannot be edited afterwards, because migration 3's immutability trigger already
     *     refuses every UPDATE on this table;
     *   * and "which rows are overdue" is answerable by one query — `activity_records_retention` —
     *     on a morning when nothing has run for a month. `index.ts` scrapes that view into
     *     `activity_retention_overdue_total`, which is the alarm for the job having died.
     *
     * The trigger is the authority for the mapping and `retentionClassFor` in TypeScript is the
     * same rules for a reader; the CASE below is rendered from the very lists that function uses,
     * so the two cannot drift, and a test pins them against each other row by row anyway.
     *
     * DELETE stays allowed on this table, as migration 3 says at length. This migration adds the
     * second lawful reason to use it — expiry — alongside erasure, and takes nothing away.
