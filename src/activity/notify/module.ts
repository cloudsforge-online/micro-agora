/**
 * The notify module: this half of the merged process, constructed behind one function.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS FILE IS THE SEAM, AND IT IS THE ONLY PLACE `NOTIFY_INGEST_SIGNING_SECRET`, THE SMTP
 * CREDENTIALS AND THE GATEWAY TOKEN ARE REACHABLE FROM.**
 *
 * Wave M2 (micro-deploy `docs/service-merge-plan.md`) folds notify into activity's process. Two
 * services sharing a process share a heap, so what used to be a process boundary has to be made
 * out of SCOPE instead — and here that boundary is carrying real weight in both directions:
 *
 *   * `NOTIFY_INGEST_SIGNING_SECRET` authenticates an event that can mint a "your key was
 *     exported" email to any address on file. `ACTIVITY_INGEST_SECRETS` authenticates a write to
 *     the canonical record of what happened to a user's money. Neither should be able to do the
 *     other's job, and before the merge that was guaranteed by them being in different processes.
 *   * `SMTP_PASS` and `NOTIFY_GATEWAY_TOKEN` enter the process in this file's import graph and in
 *     no other. `src/index.ts` — the merged composition root — does not import `./notify/env.ts`,
 *     `./notify/email.ts` or `./notify/channels.ts`, so it never holds an `SmtpConfig` and cannot
 *     pass one anywhere.
 *
 * The three layers, each of which fails closed on its own:
 *
 *   1. **`./env.ts` is imported HERE and nowhere above.** The host's import graph does not reach
 *      it.
 *   2. **`NotifyModule` carries no credential-bearing field.** What this function RETURNS is five
 *      things the host process needs — routes, a readiness probe, a scrape hook and a lifetime —
 *      and none of them names a secret.
 *   3. **Each module's handlers close over their OWN deps.** `handle` takes only `ctx`, so
 *      activity's ingest handler has no `deps` parameter to reach through and vice versa.
 *
 * `src/moduleboundary.test.ts` fails if any of the three is edited away, and it is written so that
 * it cannot pass by finding nothing.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Everything below is `notify/src/index.ts` as it stood, in the same order and for the same stated
 * reasons. What changed is only what a module in somebody else's process cannot own: the listener,
 * the `Lifecycle`, the `Verifier` and the `Metrics` registry are the HOST's and are passed in; the
 * database pool, the channel adapters, the pipeline, the job queue and the job runner are this
 * module's and are built here.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does **not** do: run migrations. That is `src/migrator.ts`, a
 * separate one-shot process — AD-17 and rule 7.

  //
  // activity keeps one DATABASE per network and refuses a network it holds no handle for. notify
  // is a class B′ singleton (micro-deploy `docs/network-consolidation.md` §5): ONE pipeline, ONE
  // SMTP allowance, ONE dead-letter view, and the network is a COLUMN — `deliveries.network`,
  // added by the `delivery-network` migration. There is no `NOTIFY_DATABASE_URL_TESTNET` and there
  // must not be: two pipelines would mean two allowances against one 150/day account and two
  // places to look when somebody says they got nothing.
  //
  // So this selector answers BOTH networks with the SAME handle, and it says so out loud rather
  // than registering one and letting `for('testnet')` throw. That refusal is exactly right for
  // activity and would be a REGRESSION here: notify serves testnet requests today, out of this
  // database, with the estate stamped on the row.
  //
  // What it buys is the thing `RouteSpec.sql` exists for: every route below carries this selector,
  // so `ctx.sql` inside a notify handler is NOTIFY's pool whichever estate the request came from,
  // and can never be activity's. Both databases own a table called `inbox` with identical columns,
  // so the mistake this prevents is not a type error at the wire — it is an insert into the other
  // module's dedupe table that succeeds and makes the next genuine delivery a "duplicate".
