/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Plain `node:http`, following the service template: the parts that matter — request ids, RED
 * metrics, the child logger, the error shape, the auth-fault mapping — are framework-independent,
 * and a template that imports a framework decides for twenty-two services that have not been
 * written yet.
 *
 * Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does
 * not pass CI.
 *
 * The one decision that is easy to get backwards is the auth-fault mapping. A bad token is 401. A
 * verifier that could not reach the JWKS is **503**, never 401 — answering 401 there signs every
 * user in the estate out because the identity service is having a bad minute.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **WAVE M2: THE REQUEST LIFECYCLE MOVED OUT AND THE ROUTES STAYED.**
 *
 * The matcher, the request id, the network attribution, the in-flight gauge and the two RED
 * metrics used to be in this file and are now `../kernel.ts`, shared with the module this one is
 * mounted beside. Two copies of that code in one process is the thing most worth not having: they
 * agreed line for line, and the first time they stopped agreeing the difference would be invisible.
 *
 * What changed shape here, and nothing else did:
 *
 *   * **Every handler closes over `deps` instead of taking it as a parameter.** Two modules in one
 *     process do not share one dependency bag — this one holds `NOTIFY_INGEST_SIGNING_SECRET` and
 *     the SMTP pipeline, the other holds `ACTIVITY_INGEST_SECRETS` — so a `deps` parameter threaded
 *     by the kernel would have to be a union of the two.
 *   * **`ctx.param` became `idOf(ctx)`**, because the shared matcher names its parameters. Same
 *     decode, same single `:id` segment, and a malformed percent-escape is now a 400 rather than a
 *     `URIError` thrown inside the request listener — see `idOf`.
 *   * **`POST /ingest` became `POST /ingest/notify`.** Both merged modules mounted `/ingest` and
 *     they verify it with different secrets. See `NOTIFY_INGEST_PATH`.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ## The ingest path is authenticated by a signature, and by nothing else
 *
 * An HMAC over the raw body. It proves the body was produced by something holding the ingest
 * secret, and carries a timestamp inside the signed message so a captured request expires. The
 * signature is verified over the **raw bytes**, before parsing. Verifying a re-serialised object
 * would compare a MAC over bytes nobody sent.

 * ever notice was dead. activity's win, because activity is the module the estate's monitoring
 * already points at: it holds the only public router of the pair, and it is the one a beacon
 * synthetic monitor probes.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by it. `/metrics` renders the host's registry, which this module's views write
 * into, so every `notify_*` series is on the merged page; `beforeScrape` above is what keeps its
 * gauges fresh, and `probe` is what keeps `/readyz` honest about this module's database.
 *
 * It is a filter and NOT a deletion from `server.ts` because that table is also the one
 * `createServer` mounts, which is the surface `server.test.ts` drives on its own — and because the
 * standalone micro-notify service is still deployed until cutover.
