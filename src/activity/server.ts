 * because there is no parameter it would arrive through, and it cannot hand notify's routes
 * activity's, for the same reason in the other direction.
 *
 * Order is first-wins, and activity goes first for one reason that matters: `/livez`, `/readyz`
 * and `/metrics` are activity's in this process (see `notify/module.ts`'s `mountableRoutes` for
 * why), and a mounted module must not be able to shadow them by accident. A shadowed health
 * endpoint looks exactly like a live one.
 *
 * Checked rather than assumed: apart from those three the path sets are disjoint, and the ingest
 * collision that made them not disjoint is resolved by giving each module a path of its own —
 * `/ingest/activity` and `/ingest/notify`, with the bare `/ingest` answering 410 naming both.

 *   1. **The three operational paths are dropped.** One process serves ONE `/livez`, ONE `/readyz`
 *      and ONE `/metrics`, and in agora's process they are agora's — the target Prometheus scrapes
 *      and the endpoints the kubelet probes. Mounting a second copy would make it dead on arrival
 *      (first-wins matching), and a dead health endpoint looks exactly like a live one. A FILTER
 *      rather than a deletion from `./routes.ts`, because that table is also what `createServer`
 *      mounts and what `server.test.ts` drives.
 *   2. **Every surviving route is stamped with THIS module's selector.** Sixteen schemas in this
 *      process own a table called `jobs` and thirteen own an `inbox` with the same three columns.
 *      A handler handed another module's handle does not fail: `insert into inbox …` SUCCEEDS,
 *      dedupes an event that database has never seen, and reports nothing. `RouteSpec.sql` is what
 *      makes that unspellable — see `../kernel.ts`.
 *
 * The bare `POST /ingest` 410 stays mounted. It is the only answer this process has for the path
 * every pre-M2 producer still names, and its body now lists every signed inbox the merged process
 * serves — see `INGEST_PATHS` in `./routes.ts`.
