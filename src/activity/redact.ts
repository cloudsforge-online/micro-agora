/**
 * THE PAYLOAD ALLOWLIST: what may be written to `activity_records.payload`, and what may not.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **UNTIL THIS FILE EXISTED, THE PRODUCING SERVICE DECIDED WHAT THIS SERVICE STORED FOR EVER.**
 *
 * `ingest.ts` wrote `envelope.payload` verbatim into a jsonb column, with no allowlist and no
 * redaction, on a table with no retention period. The failure mode that makes that a defect rather
 * than a shortcut is not a hypothetical: **a producer starts including a personal field in an event
 * payload, it is stored permanently, and no code anywhere notices.** There is no diff in this
 * repository on the day it happens. There is no test that goes red. The first person to find out is
 * whoever answers the subject access request.
 *
 * ## It happened while this was being written
 *
 * `identity.email.verification_requested` was registered in `contracts-events` and its payload is
 * (`identity/src/emailVerification.ts`):
 *
 *     { userId, handle, email, expiresAt, linkable, verifyUrl? }
 *
 * `email` is a direct identifier. `verifyUrl` is a **live single-use credential** — identity's own
 * header says so and accepts the trade for `notify`, which needs the link to send it and prunes its
 * rows. Activity subscribes to every domain topic (AD-11) and needs neither field for anything.
 * Under the old code both would have landed here, verbatim, in a row nothing deletes. That is the
 * whole argument for this file, and it arrived by itself.
 *
 * ## The rule for a KNOWN topic: a key not declared is not stored
 *
 * Every entry in `CLASSIFIERS` declares `payloadKeys`. The property is required by
 * `TopicClassifier`, and the table is `satisfies Readonly<Record<TopicName, TopicClassifier>>`, so
 * **a topic added without a declaration does not compile** — it cannot default to "store
 * everything", which is the property that makes this survive the next fifty topics.
 *
 * The declaration is deliberately *what this build reads*, not *what the producer sends*. That is
 * what makes migration 3's description of the column — "for a classified record it is the evidence
 * behind the summary" — true rather than aspirational, and it is checked both ways by
 * `THE RULE: a classifier may not read a payload key it has not declared`, which drives every
 * classifier against a recording Proxy: a key read but not declared fails, and a key declared but
 * never read fails too. Minimality is not a style preference here — an undeclared second party's id
 * left in a payload is a row that the erasure of *that* party can never reach.
 *
 * A declared key is still bounded, because a key allowlist says nothing about what the value holds:
 * strings are capped, and a nested object or array under a declared key is treated as undeclared
 * and reduced to its shape. Declaring `payload.details` must not be a way to declare everything.
 *
 * ## The rule for an UNKNOWN topic: shape survives, free text does not
 *
 * The quarantine is the dangerous path and it has no declaration to check against, by definition.
 * Both simple answers are wrong. Dropping the payload destroys the reclassification the quarantine
 * exists for — the record would be reduced to a topic name and a timestamp, and 04-domain-model's
 * promise that a quarantined row "can be reclassified from data that was never thrown away" would
 * be false. Keeping it verbatim is exactly the defect above, on the one path where this service has
 * the *least* idea what it is holding.
 *
 * The middle answer is that reclassification needs the payload's **shape and identifiers**, and
 * never its prose:
 *
 *   * Structure is preserved — every key name, at every depth, within bounds.
 *   * A value is kept only if its **syntax alone** proves it is not free text: a uuid, a
 *     `user:<uuid>`-style subject, a `urn:cloudsforge:` reference, an ISO-8601 timestamp, a decimal
 *     number, an asset code, a `0x` hash, a boolean, a number, or null.
 *   * Everything else is replaced by a descriptor naming its type and length — `"<string:31>"`.
 *
 * An email address, a postal address, a display name and a document reference all fail every one of
 * those shapes, and there is no producer change that can make them pass. An engineer writing the
 * missing classifier sees the full key structure and every identifier, which is what the job needs.
 *
 * **Short enum tokens are refused, and that is the cost, chosen deliberately.** `origin: 'external'`
 * and `outcome: 'razed'` are exactly the sort of value a reclassifier would like, and a rule that
 * kept short lowercase words would keep them. It would also keep `handle: 'savvaniss'` and
 * `firstName: 'anna'`, because a handle and a given name are **indistinguishable from an enum token
 * by shape** — and a handle is a direct identifier, not a hint. So the token is refused and
 * `"<string:8>"` is stored instead. The reclassifier loses nothing it cannot get from the producer's
 * own contract package, which is where the enum is defined and versioned in the first place.
 *
 * **Identifiers are kept on purpose, and erasure is the reason.** A uuid is personal data, so
 * keeping it needs a justification of its own: it is what lets `eraseUser` reach a quarantined row
 * that belongs to a user nobody ever attributed it to. Dropping the uuid would leave the rest of
 * the row behind with no way to find it — the defect would move rather than close. Keep the
 * identifier so there is something to destroy, and destroy it on request.
