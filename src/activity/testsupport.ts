/**
 * Shared setup for the database tests, and the delivery builder.
 *
 * **A database test runs only against a database whose name says it is a test database.** That is
 * not a convenience: `resetActivity` truncates every table in the schema, and requiring "test" in
 * the name is the difference between a red build and an emptied environment.
 *
 * `delivery()` builds and signs an event with the real `makeEvent`, `serialiseEvent` and
 * `signDelivery` from `@cloudsforge/contracts-events`. Nothing here hand-rolls an envelope or a
 * signature: a test that signed with its own implementation would pass against a service that had
 * stopped agreeing with the contract, which is the single failure this whole package exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Not a test file itself — it is excluded from the build and contains no `test()` call.
